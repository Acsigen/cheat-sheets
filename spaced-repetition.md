## The curve of forgetting

![The curve of forgetting](https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/sites/ca.campus-wellness/files/styles/body-500px-wide/public/uploads/images/curve_0-500x231.gif?itok=KLIKAnPx)

On day 1, at the beginning of the lecture, you go in knowing nothing, or 0%, (where the curve starts at the baseline). At the end of the lecture you know 100% of what you know, however well you know it (where the curve rises to its highest point).

By day 2, if you have done nothing with the information you learned in that lecture, didn't think about it again, read it again, etc. you will have lost 50%-80% of what you learned. Our brains are constantly recording information on a temporary basis: scraps of conversation heard on the sidewalk, what the person in front of you is wearing. Because the information isn't necessary, and it doesn't come up again, our brains dump it all off, along with what was learned in the lecture that you actually do want to hold on to!

By day 7, we remember even less, and by day 30, we retain about 2%-3% of the original hour! This nicely coincides with midterm exams, and may account for feeling as if you've never seen this before in your life when you're studying for exams - you may need to actually re-learn it from scratch.

You can change the shape of the curve! Reprocessing the same chunk of information sends a big signal to your brain to hold onto that data. When the same thing is repeated, your brain says, "Oh - there it is again, I better keep that." When you are exposed to the same information repeatedly, it takes less and less time to "activate" the information in your long term memory and it becomes easier for you to retrieve the information when you need it.

__The formula:__ 

* within 24 hours of getting the information - spend 10 minutes reviewing and you will raise the curve almost to 100% again
* a week later (day 7), it only takes 5 minutes to "reactivate" the same material, and again raise the curve
* by day 30, your brain will only need 2-4 minutes to give you the feedback, "yes, I know that...".
