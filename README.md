# SysAdmin Playground

Test stash

This repository intends to be a collection of useful commands and scripts to perform the most mundane tasks of a system administrator daily life.

Most of the commands are distribution agnostic, but some of them are written for Debian based distributions (mostly Ubuntu) or RHEL based distributions (CentOS/Alma/Rocky).

**Most of these commands must be run as root (not recommended) or with sudo. I was too lazy to add sudo for each command.**

Most of the time you will work from a terminal window. Use the [following color scheme](https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules/) to make your terminal look better:

- Background colour: `#222222`
- Text colour: `#F2F2F2`
