# SysAdmin Playground

This repository intends to be a collection of useful commands and scripts to perform the most mundane tasks of a system administrator daily life.

Most of the commands are distribution agnostic, but some of them are written for Debian based distributions (mostly Ubuntu) or RHEL based distributions (CentOS/Alma/Rocky).

__Most of these commands must be run as root (not recommended) or with sudo. I was too lazy to add sudo for each command.__
