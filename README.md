# SysAdmin Playground

This repository intends to be a collection of useful commands and scripts to perform the most mundane tasks of a system administrator daily life.

The repository was mostly created to perform my daily tasks. Feel free to fork it but I won't accept pull requests unless I'll find the contents useful to me.

Most of the commands are distribution agnostic, but some of them are written for Debian based distributions (mostly Ubuntu) or RHEL based distributions (CentOS/Alma/Rocky).

__Most of these commands must be run as root (not recommended) or with sudo. I was too lazy to add sudo for each command.__
