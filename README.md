# SysAdmin Playground

This repository intends to be a collection of useful commands and scripts to perform the most mundane tasks of a system administrator daily life.

The repository was mostly created to perform my daily tasks. Feel free to fork it but I won't accept pull requests unless I'll find the contents useful to me.
