# Alias

Sometimes typing commands can get really repetitive, or if you need to type a long command many times, itâ€™s best to have an alias you can use for that.

To create an alias for a command you simply specify an alias name and set it to the command.

```bash
alias ls='ls -lah'
```

This won't survive a reboot so you might want to set the alias in `~/.bashrc` if you want to make it permanent.

According to `~/.bashrc` file, You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like `~/.bash_aliases`, instead of adding them to `~/.bashrc`.

Make sure that the `~/.bashrc` file contains the following piece of code:

```bash
if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
    . ~/.bash_aliases
fi
```

After editing the file you can aplly the changes on the fly by running `source ~/.bashrc`.

To remove the alias just execute:

```bash
unalias ls
```
