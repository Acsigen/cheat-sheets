# PostgreSQL

## Prerequisites

Basic configuration and management of PostgreSQL.

## Installation and configuration

### Installation

Install the database server according to the documentation install notes.

Initialise the server:

```bash
postgresql-setup --initdb

# or

/usr/pgsql-14/bin/postgresql-14-setup initdb
```

### Access the shell

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

### Secure access

The default authentication method is *peer* for the database administrator, meaning it gets the clientâ€™s operating system user name from the operating system and checks if it matches the requested database user name to allow access, for local connections.  
During the installation process, a system user account called postgres was created without a password, this is also the default database administrator user name.

Access the shell:

```bash
 sudo -u postgres psql
```

Create user and database:

```sql
CREATE USER newuser WITH PASSWORD 'newuserpass';
CREATE DATABASE production_db1 OWNER newuser;
```

Exit the shell:

```sql
\q
```

PostgreSQL is listening on port *5432*, so please configure the firewall accordingly.

**It is not recommended to allow access from public interfaces without setting up SSL for data in transit.**

Configure allowed hosts:

```bash
vim /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
```

```conf
host production_db1 newuser 1.2.3.4/32 md5
```

**If you want to connect to the database using ```psql``` from the localhost you will need to set ```md5``` to Unix domain socket connections only (by default is peer).**

The format of the configuration aboseis the following:

* host
* database
* user
* address
* auth-method

Configure listening address:

```bash
vim /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf
```

```conf
listen_addresses = 'localhost,1.2.3.4/32'
```

Restart the service:

```bash
systemctl restart postgresql
```

## Manage the database

Login as database user from localhost:

```bash
psql -U newuser -d production_db1
```

Show existing databases and use one of them then show a list of existing tables:

```sql
\l

--or

\list

--or

SELECT datname FROM pg_database;

\connect production_db1
\dt
```

Create table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (id integer NOT NULL, first_name char(10) NOT NULL, city char(15), country char(20) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id));
```

Insert data into the table:

```sql
INSERT INTO users VALUES(1,'John','London','UK');
```

Show contents of the users table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

Add/remove column:

In PostgreSQL you can only append a column, you cannot insert a column where you want:

```sql
 -- Add column
 ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN last_name char (20);

-- Delete column
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN city; 
```

Update a value:

```sql
UPDATE users SET id = 3 WHERE first_name = 'John';
```

Delete row:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 3;
```

Delete database and user:

```sql
DROP DATABASE production_db1;
DROP USER newuser;
```

## Backup & restore

To backup the database you need to use ```pg_dump```:

```bash
# Switch user
sudo -i -u postgres

# Backup the entire database
pg_dump production_db1 > production_db1.sql

# Backup only the schema
pg_dump production_db1 --schema-only > production_db1_schema.sql
```

Restore the database:

```bash
pg_dump production_db1 < production_db1.sql
```

## Script variables

In case you want to use a script to connect to the database and perform some actions, you can use ```PGPASSWORD``` to pass the password.

**This is not recommended because the password is stored in cleartext. You can use ```PGPASSFILE``` to specify the location of the password file to use for lookups.**
