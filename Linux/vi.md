# vi text editor

## Prerequisites

This guide shows you the basic of basics. I usually use ```nano``` but if you find yourself in a situation where nano, or any other editor is not available, you can use the commands in this guide.

## Basic commands

Create/Edit file

```bash
vi filename.txt
```

Edit the file by pressing __INSERT__.  
Exit the editing mode by pressing __ESC__.  
To save the changes exit the edit mode and type ```:wq!``` and press __Enter__.
